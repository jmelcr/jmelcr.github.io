**It is out!!**

After about 1 year of research and
about another year of peer review,
our paper on the permeability of cell membranes is finally out!

The full reference is in [publications](publications), here only a direct link using 
DOI: [10.1038/s41467-022-29272-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29272-x). 

I won't go into too much detail
because the summary was already well written by Science Linx
as [How cells control their borders](https://www.rug.nl/sciencelinx/nieuws/2022/03/how-cells-control-their-borders?lang=en).

Here, I would love to share how an unexpected journey this was. 
We started with Jacopo on this project by measuring the permeability of lipid membranes
trying to answer the question, 
why is the permeability so different for some species?
Through a thorough systematic research combining both
experimental and theoretical approaches,
we have made progress and suprised ourselves with the fundamental result we obtained.

The yeast plasma membrane must be in a very rigid state 
highly similar to the *gel phase* known from model lipid membranes. 

In the beginning, 
I would think that such a thing must be already known and well described for decades
as permeability of cell membranes is their very fundamental property‚Äîthat is why membranes are ther in the first place!

Clearly, there are still some areas in research, 
which yield unexpected discoveries
of very fundamental character.
Challenging the assumptions about the structure of the cell membranes
was a key step in our discovery. 

And, this is the first paper I have with 
a real [knight](https://www.rug.nl/news/2021/04/bert-poolman-appointed-knight-in-the-order-of-the-dutch-lion)! üòÅ
