*Can two parents with a family pursue both a career in research?*
That is the question 
we have pondered with my wife 
in her nice blog post
about our path through research
posted on [LinedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/czexpats-in-science_nov%C3%BD-blog-ad%C3%A9la-melcrov%C3%A1-popisuje-svou-kari%C3%A9rn%C3%AD-activity-6824060603364081664-5u3l) 
and on [Czexpats blog](http://czexpatsinscience.cz/blog-post/hledani-cesty-zivotem-a-akademickou-karierou-pro-dva-rodice-vedce-a-jejich-rodinu-adela-melcrova-22-7-2021/)
(Google Translate makes quite a good job in turning it into your language). 

If I were to give a very short summary,
I would say the following:

*Every magic comes at a price and you have to decide how much you're willing to pay and sacrifice.*

Scientific career is very stressful,
and for parents it is more than double. 

We choose family life over scientific career. 

For me, it is a very simple choice,
but not everyone understands.
I feel that a more "manly" stance is expected from me;
to seize the lead, have grit and fight and compete; 
to selfishly push myself forward and forward in front of others.
But my ways are peaceful,
which is often perceived in science as a weakness. 

I disagree.
I think that the "manly"-acting leaders
just make everyone miserable
sometimes including themselves. 
I much prefer working together over constant competition;
I see "having a grit" is just a different way of saying "be aggresive".

In contrast,
I beleive that leading with compassion is the right way,
as compassion requires inner peace and strengthâ€”and 
such features appear to me 
as qualities that are more typical for women than for men.

It takes a great strength to walk your own path
to the place, where you heart takes you. 
Definitely nothing for someone weak.
