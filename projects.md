# Current projects

- **Permeability of biological membranes:**
accurate exerimental measurements of small solutes permeability 
gets explained by my Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.
Will we open new ways to drug delivery?
Stay tuned, 
manuscript in preparation!


- **MeMBrane project: Enhancing industrial bioprocesses in yeast and bacteria via membrane optimization**
[MeMBrane project](https://www.membrane.org.uk/) 
aims at improving and creating possible new industries using cell factories and biomass. 
In collaboration with expert *in vitro* and *in vivo* research teams, 
I am using MD simulation experiments to describe and understand 
the perturbing effects of ethanol on the cell membranes, yeast membranes especially. 
At the moment, 
I am preparing a manuscript summarizing my surprising findings
that ethanol does not only affect the membrane thickness or elasticity,
but also its phase behaviour – a very important feature for yeast plasma membrane, 
which contains several coexisting phases at normal conditions!
(ref e.g. [📚JBC2010](https://www.jbc.org/content/286/7/5043.full))


- **Antimicrobial peptides against drug-resistant bacterial strains.**
Microscopy techniques are powerful and images are usually easy to interpret,
but lack the molecular detail – and that is where Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations come in!
We are working together with research teams from the Netherlands and Norway
to discover how recently developed antimicrobial agents 
selectively destroy the methicilin-resistant strains of *Staphylococus Aureus*. 
The molecular details from my MD simulations bring a few surprises!


- **Martini 3:**
Development of the new Martini 3 lipids. 
I am coordinating an international group of researchers to 
develp the next generation of highly popular 
[Martini Coarse-grained model](https://scholar.google.cz/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&qsp=3&q=martini+coarse&qst=ib) for lipids. 
Our standard is remote working,
we get things done through motivation
and close collaboration of experts from diverse fields across the globe.
[🦊GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is our workhorse for communication, 
being synchronized and working together – 
Asynchronously in our work time, 
yet in synchrony with the work done.


- **Mechanism of protein channels and transporters.**
Many cells maintain their divalent cations homeostasis 
by employing membrane proteins from the CorA family. 
GlTk is a trimeric membrane protein, 
which is involved in glutamate and aspartate uptake. 
We use atomistic and coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations
to describe the mechanistic behaviour of these proteins. 
Stay tuned, 
the manuscript about CorA is almost ready!



- **Determination of protein sctructure with optical polarization microscopy**
Polarization microscopy allows sensitive observations of changes in protein conformation in living cells and organisms ([ref.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp4067026)). 
For fluorescent proteins with a resolved structure, 
it is possible to link the polarization microscopy measurements and 
transition dipole moment orientations to protein strucutre 
([press release](https://www.osa-opn.org/home/newsroom/2020/december/exploring_the_directionality_of_fluorescent_protei/), 
[📚PNAS2020](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2017379117)). 
In this project,
I have used 
quantum mechanical calculations of absorption properties and 
molecular dynamics simulations
to help determine the orientations of membrane-attached fluorescent proteins  
and to independently verify the results 
from software analysis of optical microscopy images. 
This work is now accepted for publishing in Communications Biology 2021; 
[📚 Quantitative Linear Dichroism Imaging of Molecular Processes in Living Cells Made Simple by Open Software Tools (preprint)](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-100685/v1).  
This project is run in a close collaboration with the group of [Josef Lazar](https://lazar.group.uochb.cz/en).

# Past projects


- **ECC-lipids - implicitly polarizable lipid models showing accurate interactions with ionic molecules**
ECC-lipids is the first MD model to implicitly account for polarizability in molecules. 
Will it launch [a new "polarizable" era of MD modeling](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2019.00143/full)?
Current development of ECC-lipids is held in the [GitHub repository ecc_lipids](https://github.com/jmelcr/ecc_lipids)
with a separate [web page with documentation](https://jmelcr.github.io/ecc_lipids/).



- **Transmembrane potential modeling in molecular simulation**
All eukaryotic cells maintain a nonzero transmembrane potential across their plasma membranes. It is a crucial feature for many kinds of our organs, e.g. brain, heart, pancreas.
In this project, 
I assay current approaches for the modeling of transmembrane potential in molecular simulation 
and describe the electrical processes at biomembranes at a molecular resolution.
Published in Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, 12 (5), 2016. DOI: [10.1021/acs.jctc.5b01202](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b01202).


- **Development of membrane-bound probes of cellular functions**
We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to rationally develop probes of cellular functions, 
especially neural activity. Such probes are intended to work with accurate polarization microscopy measurements, 
which can detect their structural changes.
Development of fluorescent molecular probes of cell membrane voltage promises to deliver the ability
of observing the electrical activity of neuronal assemblies using an optical microscope. 
This project is run in a close collaboration with the group of [Josef Lazar](https://www.uochb.cz/web/structure/1408.html?lang=en). 

-  Development of classical force field parameters for organometallic compounds compatible with Amber force field.

-  Enzymatic activity of EF-Tu, a protein factor that takes part in the process of translation on the Ribozome.
