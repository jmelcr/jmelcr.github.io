Some of my core mottos.

**"Never be afraid of the next adventure 
   even if outside of your comfort zone.
   Embrace discomfort as your new comfort.
   That is the way of pioneers."**

**"Do what you think is right, 
   keep your direction and 
   never be swayed easily, 
   but
   listen to advice,
   practice compassion and
   build trust."**
   
**"Smile, smile a lot
   and stay on top of things.
   Smile with dignity 
   to the World 
   as well as 
   to Your-very-self."**

I beleive that life is more delightful
when I am pro-active. 
I like opportunities and challenges
that require creative work and allow me to grow. 
That is why I like all
scientific research, 
photography,
music,
writing scientific papers,
cooking,
writing poetry 
as well as
raising our children. 
Because at the core of all these activities
I find creative work
which brings me joy and satisfaction. 

We are a scientific family;
both me and [my wife](https://miss-biophys.tumblr.com/) 
work as scientists.
When we had our first child, 
my wife was expected to take care 
and put her PhD research on a second track. 
I found that unacceptable. 
In spite of the expectations around us,
we shared the care of our lovely toddler
and both worked part-time.
Why did I decide to do that?
Why did I not just take the easier option?
Because it was the right thing to do –
a real support that all women, not only in science, need.
It was a very joyful period of our lives
and we managed to obtain our PhD degree at about the same time. 
At the moment we live in Groningen in the North of the Netherlands,
where we perform our research in biotechnology and drug development.
