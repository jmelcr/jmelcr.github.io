Writing writing writing — that's how I would describe my past days. 

On top of the full mailbox, we are finalizing a manuscript with Jacopo - our first external visitor on our virtual group meeting.  We have advanced from the status of a "tentative preliminary _surprisingly good_ agreement" between Martini and permeability measurements we presented about a year ago to a systematic assessment of the whole phenomena.  I think I will give a peek under the hood of this work in my "roughly-anniversary" group meeting next week. 

In addition, I had another _writing_  to do, but which had made me happy – I am proud that Masha's hard work with the CorA protein was finalized in a nice manuscript, which has received quite a positive feedback from the reviewers last week!  Despite the writing-fight is not over yet, I have no doubts this manuscript will be published soon, yay!

And did I tell you – we have cats?  They are almost the same, twin brothers, as white as a cloud and totally gorgeous! Purr, purr.

That's how it goes!
