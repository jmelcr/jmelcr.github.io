*Josef 12-May 2021*
*My neighbour Totoro*

I am so glad that the weather is good today. It's still a week of school holidays and I am shepherding our kids. I take advantage of working from home and enjoy the fresh air sitting at our garden. My eyes still get sore quickly, so I have to take regular breaks from the screen. It is unpleasant but I try to take it also as a good thing to be forced to stretch your legs occasionally. 

At least girls like it.  Now and then, they bring me a picture or some flowers.  I realized that today is not that different from the scene in My neighbour Totoro, where the dad (university teacher) works at home, trying to write and calculate something longhand, and Mei keeps coming and asking questions or bringing small items like the one in the picture. 
A flower â€“ an undervalued little symbolic piece of their relationship. 

That's how it goes!
